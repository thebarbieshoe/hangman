Hangman;
This is a simple implementation of the game Hangman. Users will have 6 chances to guess letters. If the user guesses the correct letter, it will be shown in the word prompt. For example _ _ _ (C A T). User guesses C. C _ _ is displayed.

If the user guesses incorrectly, a turtle graphic is started which will show a stick figure being put in a tragic position (yes, this game is actually tres dark).

Getting Started;
This code can be downloaded and run on your own machine using IDLE.
You'll need the dictionary.txt file and the pickword.py file.


Things of Note;
This was the first project that I took on and actually chose to use more functions. And now I love functions. 

Why?

The code is prettier and feels more professional.

It's easier to step away from a project, if I've finished one entire function. Then next time I will tackle the next function required.

It's easier to read.

It's what I should have been doing from day one!
